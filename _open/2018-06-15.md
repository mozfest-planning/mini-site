### Agenda

- *Marcos* has collated blog posts from previous years but would like more if anyone knows of any.
- *Yo* to make openness twitter account
- Email Templates / who we're contacting
- *Dave* to proof read templates
- Rota for people to read-respond to comms?
- To read proposals?
  - Should we have an openness mini-site forthe public (e.g. a github pages) with contact methods for us and eventually maybe FAQ?
  - A FAQ would be nice, and I was also thinking about having an AMA session (could be done with etherpad) - and the AMA could feed the FAQ.
  - Found a page from last year Open Innovation space, here: https://science.mozilla.org/blog/mozfest-cfp-2017 (I think that having a mini-site  would be awesome!)
  - Let's make this!
- Include subscription options,
- privacy policy
- Who wants to do this....?
- Ask the group! If not, Marcos will step up
