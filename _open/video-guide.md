##Â Share your MozFest experiences with others? 

Have you been to MozFest before as an attendee, facilitator, wrangler, or volunteer? This is your chance to share what it meant for you in a short video. 

Feel free to share any of the following: 

 - your favourite sessions you attended in previous years
 - something you learned from a session
 - how you felt attending! Were you excited, shy, overwhelmed, having so much fun you were exhausted? ;) 
 - your plans for a session you've proposed
 - what it was like to facilitate a session in a previous year.
 - the awesome people you met or connections you made. 
 - probably loads of other things! 
 
 ## How to submit a video
 
All you need is a device that can record video (e.g. phone, tablet, laptop, etc.) and a few minutes to record your thoughts! [Zannah made some great tips on recording a video](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kCj_PI0f_YqZiS4ZKTDYt96UqerBErNloFhl5FZwuU/edit) that you can check out if you like.
Once you're happy with your recording, tweet [@mozfestOpenness](https://twitter.com/mozfestopenness) with a youtube link, or email mozopenness2018@googlegroups.com with the link / video. We can't wait to see what you've created! <3
