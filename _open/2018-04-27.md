## Space Narrative

Openness on the web extends to many disciplines, from software and hardware to education, research, journalism, and politics.

Working open allows us to share, collaborate on, promote, revise, and refine our work. But being open in a safe, effective way isnâ€™t always straightforward. In an era of personal data misuse and breaches, we need to think carefully about how open we are, with whom, and for what purposes.

Openness on the web impacts everyone, so this Space welcomes sessions and participants from different disciplines, experience levels, and backgrounds. Join us to discuss, share experiences, and learn how to work open. Come with an open mind!
