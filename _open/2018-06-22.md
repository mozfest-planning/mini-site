 GitHub teams for comms / session management?
https://github.com/orgs/MozillaFestival/teams/2018-web-literacy-wranglers/discussions - example
maybe we should use this and forget airtables :)
MozFest experience videos: Mariano keen to champion this.
Try setting up some basic instructions / guides to make it easy for people to do - maybe create a sample video
Mariano will cover this
Zannah has a tip sheet she can share!  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kCj_PI0f_YqZiS4ZKTDYt96UqerBErNloFhl5FZwuU/edit
New twitter account: https://twitter.com/mozfestopenness
you should all have access to tweet from this via tweetdeck!
follow, RT, encourage others to collow, etc :)
'What is cooking in the OPEN kitchen' blog post series to show transparency about our planning? (let's brainstorm)
+1 I like this idea!
Princiya to set up
send to sessions mailing group and make it generic enough others can re-use <3
contact details for each space
FAQs
weekly updates with the ability to search what each space is upto, blogs published etc.
Sarah suggests a slackbot question that happens weekly...
6. Sarah: how are you getting on? With outreach, comms, and blogging, what roles has everyone taken on, do you understand Github
Finding all the platforms hard to trach
who are we contacting as part of our outreach? Who do we want there?
advise looking close to home first, share with local meet ups, on your twitter,contact other festivals looking for ideas
Need follow up email after Wrangler call with clear outlines of deadlines and reminders
Set up slack bots or make calendar for the team
Princiya will share team pages
Questions: do we have metrics of access to Github? (Mariano)

I couldn't track if blog post about Enindhoven were published. (Mariano)
